# Doubleheader
## Goal
Doubleheader is a basic example project that will require minimal modification from the user to connect to their personal [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.  This repository contains everything you will need to deploy a sample "Hello World" web page to an [Elastic Beanstalk (EB)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) environment via [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the [EB Command Line Interface (EB CLI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html), the deployment process will then automatically upload sample website content to an S3 bucket via auto-installation of the [s3cmd tool.](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)  This project can be expanded upon for your own use to help you serve up an entire website without having to manually upload projects to EB and assets to S3.
